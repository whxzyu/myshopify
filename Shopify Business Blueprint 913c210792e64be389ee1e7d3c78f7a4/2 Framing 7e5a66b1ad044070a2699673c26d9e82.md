# 1.¬†**Navigate your competitive landscape**

<aside>
üîÑ **Recap:** In the first section, you established the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind starting your business, and brainstormed ideas for your business.

</aside>

**Navigating your competition will be something you‚Äôll need to weather at every stage of your business.**

However, that‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing. Just because aspects of your idea exist in one form, doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt room for another player in the market. The key to navigating your competition will be to think about what will allow your business to shine amongst your competitors. The success of a business can depend on its unique selling proposition (USP). A USP is what makes a business stand out from competitors and ultimately what makes it ‚Äúunique‚Äù.

For example, let‚Äôs use the hot sauce market. Think of how many different hot sauces are at the grocery store. These companies all sell the same product (hot sauce), but they stand out in different ways. Some hot sauces are organic and use different peppers, some have bright and fun packaging, while some may have drawbacks like containing high amounts of sugar or sodium. USPs can include locally sourced ingredients, cool packaging, healthy ingredients, and more.

‚ö° **Hot Tip:** Think about more than just pricing. Compete by offering distinctive, quality products or services, targeting diverse audiences, and developing new and interesting features to highlight.

### 2. **Search online for competitors in your industry.**

You can make your business stand out by researching your competitors and finding where a USP could be most effective. Once you‚Äôve found two competitors, fill out the following profiles, looking for gaps where you can position your business in a different way.

**Competitor 1**: **[Name]**

# 1. **Find your target audience**

**It would be great if everybody was a potential customer for your business, but that‚Äôs rarely ever the case.**

In fact, marketing your business is more difficult and less efficient when you don‚Äôt have a specific target in mind.

Instead, think about who the *ideal audience* for your business would be ‚Äî the groups of people who need the least amount of convincing or selling to buy from you.

Your ideal audience profile doesn‚Äôt need to be 100% accurate (we‚Äôre using our imagination here), but this exercise should make it easier for you to make key decisions around product development, branding, and marketing with this audience in mind.
