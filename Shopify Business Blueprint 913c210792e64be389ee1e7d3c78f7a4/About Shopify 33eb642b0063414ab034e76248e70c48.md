# **Shopify powers millions of businesses worldwide**

### The all-in-one commerce platform to start, run, and grow¬†a¬†business.

**SHOPIFY STORY**

## **The first Shopify store was¬†our¬†own**

Over a decade ago, we started a store to sell snowboards online. None of the ecommerce solutions at the time gave us the control we needed to be successful‚Äîso we built our own. Today, businesses of all sizes use Shopify, whether they‚Äôre selling online, in retail stores, or on-the-go.

**OUR MISSION**

## **Making commerce better for everyone**

We help people achieve independence by making it easier to start, run, and grow a business. We believe the future of commerce has more voices, not fewer, so we‚Äôre reducing the barriers to business ownership to make commerce better for everyone.

**OUR PEOPLE**

## **Creating a community for¬†impact**

Shopify has grown from 5 people in a coffee shop to over 5,000 across the globe. With millions of businesses powered by Shopify, we care deeply about the work we do. We‚Äôre constant learners who thrive on change and seek to have an impact in everything we¬†do.

**OUR COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY**

## **We‚Äôre building a 100-year company**

Shopify builds for the long term, and that means investing in our planet, our communities, and our people. Our¬†[Sustainability Fund](https://www.shopify.ca/about/environment/sustainability-fund)¬†and¬†[Social Impact initiatives](https://www.shopify.ca/about/social-impact)¬†include choosing renewable energy, reducing and offsetting our carbon emissions, and enabling an equitable and sustainable future by building products and programs to support our team and merchants.
