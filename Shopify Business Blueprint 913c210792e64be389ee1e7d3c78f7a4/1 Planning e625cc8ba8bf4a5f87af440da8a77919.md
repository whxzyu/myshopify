# 1. Define your “why”

**You can *start* a business overnight, but having a deeper understanding of *why* you’re choosing this path is what will propel your business forward.**

Think of your “why” as the backbone and the heartbeat of your business. It’ll allow you to feel a deeper connection and remind you *why* you chose this journey when both celebrations and challenges arise. Your *why* will be the thing you come back to as an entrepreneur, whenever you celebrate a milestone or encounter an obstacle, or go from your first customer to your 100th.

Every business owner has their own unique *why* because everyone has a unique story. You can even have more than one *why* and they may change over time. Writing it out can be an eye-opening exercise that affects the way you make decisions about your business.

Some entrepreneurs are motivated by the prospect of making money while having the freedom to carve a path that’s their own. Some entrepreneurs create a side business as a way to develop supplemental income. While others may use business as a means of expressing who they are and what they care about to the world.

**Take some time to reflect on your own *why* and write it out below:**

> *“I dreamed of a brand that made products that tasted good, that had ingredients I felt good about sharing with my family. It should also be cool enough that someone without food allergies would choose to also eat it. When I couldn’t find it, I left my career to start Partake.”*

# 1. Brainstorm your business idea

**More than money or employees, the first thing you’ll need to start a business is an idea.**

It’s the seed that the rest of your business will grow from. As you move through the Business Blueprint, your idea may evolve to a point where it’s quite different than when you started. And that’s okay because by building on your initial concept with research, marketing, and finance, you’ll develop a stronger idea.

You can define a clear business idea by answering the following questions:

- What are you selling?
- Who will be your audience?
- What’s in it for your customers?

**Put it together and you have the ingredients for an awesome business idea:**

<aside>
<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vkq2a.png" alt="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vkq2a.png" width="40px" /> I’m going to sell **[thing you’re selling]** to **[audience]** so they can **[what’s in it for customers]**.

</aside>

**Here’s an example:**

<aside>
<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vkq2a.png" alt="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vkq2a.png" width="40px" /> I’m going to sell **delicious hot sauce** to **people who like spicy food** so they can **add some kick to their favorite meals**.

</aside>

<aside>
⚡ **Hot Tip:** If choosing an idea is challenging, it helps to think about what problems you could be solving for a customer. Additionally, try to pick an idea with an audience group that’s large enough to sustain and scale your business.
